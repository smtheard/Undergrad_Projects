The color table should not be interpreted as a definitive list,
the pure spectral   colors form a continuous spectrum, and
how it is divided into  distinct colors linguistically is a matter
of culture and historical contingency. A common list identifies
six main bands: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple.
Newton's conception included a seventh color, indigo, between
blue and purple. It is possible that what Newton referred to as
blue is nearer to what we today call cyan, and that indigo was
simply the dark blue of the indigo dye that was being imported
at the time.
